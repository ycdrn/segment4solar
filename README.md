# Segment4Solar

Segment4Solar is a project focusing on the analysis and segmentation of facade imagery for solar applications. 

Segment4Solar leverages two APIs to:
- **Detect available areas on facades,** where solar panels can potentially be applied onto.
- **Estimate monthly and annual energy generation** to understand how much of your demand can be met by the solar panels.

By transforming raw facade imagery into actionable data, Segment4Solar aids in the planning and management of solar installations in urban environments.
